## Overview

The Waste Management System is a web application designed to streamline and optimize waste collection and management processes. This project leverages modern web technologies to provide an efficient and user-friendly interface for managing waste-related tasks.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript and React plugins
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Project Structure

- **`/src`**: Contains the source code for the application.
  - **`/components`**: Reusable React components.
  - **`/hooks`**: Custom React hooks for managing state and side effects.
  - **`/utils`**: Utility functions and helpers.
- **`/public`**: Static assets like images and the favicon.
- **`/dist`**: The build output directory (ignored in version control).

## Key Features

- **React Hooks**: Utilized for state management and side effects.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience.
- **ESLint**: Configured with recommended settings for JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.
- **React Refresh**: Enables fast refresh for a better development experience.

## Linting Configuration

The project uses a custom ESLint configuration that extends recommended settings for JavaScript and TypeScript. It includes plugins for React Hooks and React Refresh to enforce best practices and improve development workflow.

```javascript
import js from "@eslint/js";
import globals from "globals";
import reactHooks from "eslint-plugin-react-hooks";
import reactRefresh from "eslint-plugin-react-refresh";
import tseslint from "typescript-eslint";

export default tseslint.config(
  { ignores: ["dist"] },
  {
    extends: [js.configs.recommended, ...tseslint.configs.recommended],
    files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
    languageOptions: {
      ecmaVersion: 2020,
      globals: globals.browser,
    },
    plugins: {
      "react-hooks": reactHooks,
      "react-refresh": reactRefresh,
    },
    rules: {
      ...reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules,
      "react-refresh/only-export-components": [
        "warn",
        { allowConstantExport: true },
      ],
    },
  }
);
```
